<H2><A NAME="about"></A>About the SVG Viewer</H2>

<P>The Adobe SVG Viewer supports much of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20001102/index.html">Candidate
Recommendation</a> draft specification of SVG published on 11/2/00. Please
keep in mind that the specification is under development, and will continue to
evolve until it is made a recommended specification.


<H2><A NAME="installing"></A>How to install the SVG Viewer</H2>
<P><OL>
<LI>Before installing, please close any application which you have
used to view SVG with an old version of the viewer.
<LI>Run the installer. The latest released installers can be downloaded
from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install">http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install</a>.
</OL>

<H2><A NAME="copyplugin"></A>How to copy Netscape plug-ins into other Browsers</H2>
<P>If you install another copy of Netscape which is supported by the
Netscape plug-in, you can copy the following files into your plug-ins
folder to view SVG from within that browser:
<UL>
<LI>NPSVGVw.dll
<LI>SVGView.dll
<LI>SVGViewer.zip
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="viewing"></A>How to view SVG files in your Web browser</H2>

<P>Once you install the Adobe SVG Viewer, you should be able to view 
supported SVG files in any supported Web browser.</P>

<H2><A NAME="converting"></A>How to turn artwork into SVG</H2>

<P>You can export SVG from Illustrator 9. If you wish to incorporate
JavaScript into your SVG you can create your artwork in Illustrator
and link to JavaScript functions with the JavaScript Interactivity
Pallet and then export it as SVG, or export from Illustrator and add
any JavaScript interactivity animation or filter effects by hand.</P>

<H2><A NAME="tips">Tips and Hints</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Style attributes (or style attributes that use entity references)
render more quickly than embedded stylesheets.
<LI>Use tightly-bound percentages on the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>,
<code>width</code>, and <code>height</code> attributes on <code>filter</code>
elements in order to minimize the area over which the filter effect needs to
be calculated. This will result in graphics which display much more quickly.
<li>You can retrieve the SVG document object from within SVG event
handlers by calling <code>getTarget</code> on the <code>evt</code> object
which is passed in. For example:
<pre>
  // Retrieve the SVG document object:
  var directTarget = evt.getTarget();
  var svgDocument;
  if( directTarget.getNodeType() != 9 )  // if not DOCUMENT_NODE
    svgDocument = directTarget.getOwnerDocument();
  else
    svgDocument = directTarget;
</pre>
</UL>

<P><HR>



<H2><A NAME="sysreq"></A>System Requirements</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Windows 95, 98, SE, 2000, ME, or NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 and up
<LI>Netscape Navigator or Communicator versions 4.0 through 4.75, or
Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher. Netscape 6 is <emph>not</emph> supported.
<LI>13 MB of hard disk space
<LI>32 MB of RAM recommended

<P><HR>
<H2><A NAME="problems"></A>Known Problems with the SVG Viewer</H2>

<H3><A NAME="problems_all"></A>All Browsers</H3>
<OL>
<LI>If you install the Adobe SVG Viewer as an administrator of a Windows
2000 system, you will need to view an SVG file and accept the EULA before
non-administrators can view SVG on that machine.

<li>It's possible for elements near the edge of an SVG graphic to not receive a
mouseout event.
<li>The SVG specification's support for masks has changed significantly since
Illustrator 9 shipped, so Adobe SVG Viewer 2.0 might not display SVG masks exported
from Illustrator 9.

<LI>If you have multiple Windows operating systems (such as Windows 98 and
Windows NT) installed on the same partition (for example, drive
<code>C</code>), you must install the Adobe SVG Viewer on both operating
systems. If you install it on one operating system, the Viewer will not work
correctly when you reboot under the other operating system.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="problems_ie"></A>Internet Explorer</H3>
<OL>
<li>You must have Internet Explorer 4 or higher installed in order to use
the SVG Viewer as an ActiveX control in other applications (like Microsoft
Office).
<li>If you open more than one window containing a link to the same SVG
file, and the SVG file is embedded using the HTML &lt;embed&gt; tag, then
when you print one of the windows it may print based on changes to the DOM
in the other window. This is due to limitations of Internet Explorer.
<li>Due to Internet Explorer limitations, it's not possible to see properties of
other windows from a script defined inside an SVG file.
<li>Using the Adobe SVG Netscape plug-in under Internet Explorer on Windows is
<b>not</b> supported.
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="problems_nn"></A>Netscape</H3>
<OL>

<li><!--ABTS#392459-->Netscape 4.x plug-ins cannot execute <code>onunload</code>
scripts because at the time the plug-in receives notification from Netscape
that the plug-in is being unloaded, the plug-in's script environment has already been
closed down.
<li><!--ABTS#390346-->Netscape 6.0 reports errors when printing pages with plug-ins, and then
fails to print embedded contents. Netscape will report two plugin error
alerts. Dismissing the alerts presented will then result in Netscape printing
the HTML page, but with blank area for the SVG content.
<li>When you leave a Web page, Netscape can often unload the Adobe SVG Viewer
plug-in before Netscape terminates all scripts running in the HTML. Therefore
you should be careful when writing scripts to check to see if the plug-in is
still loaded before you attempt to access the SVG DOM from
<code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> callbacks in your HTML
JavaScript.
<li>Due to design limitations of Netscape, avoid using HTML with the following form:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="#" onclick="myScriptWhichModifiesSVG()"&gt;
</pre>
<p>The problem is that JavaScript responds to the onclick event and
begins executing the script, but then Netscape also responds to the
fact that you clicked on a link, and interrupts JavaScript to re-load
the current page. This conflict can be avoided by re-writing the code
as follows:
<pre>
  &lt;a href="javascript:myScriptWhichModifiesSVG()"&gt;
</pre>
<li><!--ABTS#364416-->If a JavaScript event handler contains an error, any subsequent JavaScript will fail to
execute. This is due to a bug in Netscape's handling of scripts executed by plug-ins.
<li>Due to Netscape script limitations, you can't change the URL of another frame from
an SVG event handler.
<li>Due to Netscape script engine limitations, calling the <code>alert()</code>
function from within an SVG event handler might not work, and it might cause
subsequent JavaScript to no longer execute. Similar problems occur for any
Netscape modal window, including the security privileges window. This bug
appears to have been partially fixed by Netscape in Netscape 4.75, but not on
Windows 98.
<li><!--ABTS#392481-->There is a bug in Netscape involving plug-ins that use JavaScript. If you load a
page with a plug-in that uses JavaScript and then disable Java and quit the browser,
Netscape will crash.
<li><!--ABTS#389988-->Netscape does not always allow you to access the <code>document.embeds[]</code>
array from within an SVG script. To work around this, use <code>document.mySVG</code>,
where <code>mySVG</code> is the name of your embed object.
<li><!--ABTS#418797-->Netscape 4.x will crash if a plug-in invokes a link to a JPEG file.
To work around this problem, embed your JPEG file in HTML or SVG before you link to it
from your SVG file.

<li><!--ABTS#364417-->Errors in scripts executed by Netscape 4.x plug-ins do not show up
in the Javascript console window.
<li><!--ABTS#364461-->Netscape 4.x leaks a small amount of memory every time a plug-in
executes a script.
<li><!--ABTS#364524-->Netscape 4.x will crash when you close it if you launched
it by double-clicking to load a Web page containing LiveConnect plug-in content.
<li>If you use "Print Preview" in Netscape on a page which contains plug-ins
(such as the Adobe SVG Viewer), Netscape will crash. For a similar reason
Netscape will crash when you try to print a page containing plug-ins using Acrobat
Distiller.
<li>If you use Netscape 4.0x to view the same SVG file in two windows, and that file
uses a global JavaScript function on the window object, sometimes JavaScript will
not initialize in the second window. The work-around is to upgrade to a more recent
version of Netscape.
<li>Due to a bug in Netscape 6, attempting to right-click within the SVG area
to bring up context menu fails in Netscape 6. Instead, you get the Netscape 6
context menu.
<li><!--ABTS#402907-->Netscape 4.x on Swedish systems has a bug where it does not
identify its plug-in folder location correctly in the system registry, thereby
making it impossible for installers to install plug-ins. You can work around this
problem by copying the files by hand, as described <a href="#copyplugin">above</a>.

<H2><A NAME="history"></A>Revision History</H2>

<h3>Changes since version 1.0 of the Adobe SVG Viewer</h3>
<ul>

<li>Updated to support the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-SVG-20001102/index.html">Candidate
Recommendation</a> draft specification of SVG published on 11/2/00. The 2.0
Viewer retains backward compatibility with the 1.0 Viewer where possible, and
therefore supports much of the 3/3/00 draft specification of SVG. However, some 
features of the specification (such as the handling of CSS units) have changed
so significantly that it was not possible to retain backward compatibility.
<li>Elements and Attributes:
<ul>
<li>Added support for the following elements: <code>altGlyph</code>,
<code>altGlyphDef</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>font-face</code>,
<code>glyph</code>, <code>glyphRef</code>, <code>hkern</code>,
<code>missing-glyph</code>, <code>mpath</code>, <code>pattern</code>, 
<code>switch</code>, and <code>vkern</code>.
<li>Added support for the SVG Presentation Attributes.
<li>Finished support for <code>use</code> element use of <code>symbol</code> elements.
<li>Added support for the <code>spreadMethod</code> attribute on gradients.
<li>Added support for the new attribute <code>primitiveUnits</code> on filter effects.
<li>Added support for "discrete" mode for <code>feComponentTransfer</code>.
</ul>

<li>CSS properties:
<ul>
<li>Added support for the following CSS properties:
<code>alignment-baseline</code>, <code>color-interpolation</code>, <code>direction</code>,
<code>dominant-baseline</code>, <code>flood-color</code>,
<code>flood-opacity</code>, <code>kerning</code>, <code>lighting-color</code>,
<code>pointer-events</code>, and <code>unicode-bidi</code>. Support for the
<code>pointer-events</code> property does not include support for transparency
on raster elements.
<li>Added support for the <code>font-variant</code> property, but only when
applied to SVG fonts.
<li>Removed support for the <code>baseline-identifier</code> property, which
has been replaced with the <code>alignment-baseline</code> property in the
most recently supported specification.
<li>Changed the default values for the properties <code>clip-rule</code> and
<code>fill-rule</code> from <code>even-odd</code> to <code>non-zero</code> to
reflect the changes in the most recently supported specification.
<li>The latest Candidate Recommendation draft specification for SVG changes the
way CSS units are handled. They are now converted to user space on parse, rather
than being converted at display time. This significantly changes the way the "Zoom"
command works.
</ul>

<li>DOM:
<ul>
<li>The Viewer's DOM Level 2 support now conforms to the Candidate Release
specification for DOM 2, except for the <code>keyEvent</code> interface, which
is not specified in the DOM 2 Candidate Release specification. Support for the
<code>keyEvent</code> interface conforms to the last DOM 2 published version of
that interface, in the 9/99 draft specification.
<li>Added support for the <code>SVGRect</code> interface.
<li>Added support for the <code>SVGPoint</code> interface, except for the method
<code>matrixTransform</code>.
<li>Added support for the <code>SVGTextContentElement</code> interface, except
for the <code>getTextLength</code> and <code>getLengthAdjust</code> properties.
<li>Added support for <code>rootElement</code>, <code>getRootElement</code>,
<code>currentScale</code>, <code>getCurrentScale</code>, <code>setCurrentScale</code>,
<code>currentTranslate</code>, <code>getCurrentTranslate</code>, and 
<code>setCurrentTranslate</code> on the <code>SVGDocument</code> interface.
<li>Added support for the DOM2 methods <code>hasAttribute</code> and
<code>hasAttributeNS</code> on the <code>Element</code> interface.
<li>Added support for a new, non-standard, method on the <code>Document</code>
object called <code>garbageCollect</code>. This method takes no parameters
and returns no results. Calling this method will free up any Node objects that
have previously been removed from the tree. If a script has performed an
operation that results in the removal of a node from the tree, once the script
has no further use for the removed (and returned) node, the script should call
<code>garbageCollect</code> on the SVG document. Once called, any reference
a script has to a node which was not part of the document when
<code>garbageCollect</code> was called will always fail when its methods are
accessed. This is only of benefit for Netscape browsers, since Netscape's
LiveConnect does not offer weak reference support. For easy cross-platform
support, this call can be made under Internet Explorer, but it will do nothing
on that platform.
</ul>

<li>Other Changes:
<ul>
<li>To conform to the latest Candidate Recommendation draft specification for
SVG, support for <code>userSpace</code> units has been dropped.
<li>Added support for user stylesheets. The SVG Viewer looks for a file named
<code>SVG-User-Styles.css</code>, according to the following search strategy:

<p><table align="center" width="70%">
<tr><td align="center" bgcolor="#EEEEEE">Operating System</td><td align="center" bgcolor="#EEEEEE" colspan="2">Paths Searched</td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Windows 2000</td><td><ol>
<li>My Documents
<li>\Documents And Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data
<li>\Documents And Settings\&lt;user&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data
<li>\Documents And Settings\All Users\Application Data
</ol></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Windows 98</td><td><ol>
<li>My Documents
</ol></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Windows NT</td><td><ol>
<li>\WINNT\Profiles\&lt;user&gt;\Personal
<li>\WINNT\Profiles\&lt;user&gt;\Application Data
</ol></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Macintosh OS 8.x</td><td><ol>
<li>System Folder:Preferences
<li>Startup Volume:Documents
</ol></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Macintosh OS 9.x<br>(single-user)</td><td><ol>
<li>System Folder:Preferences
<li>System Folder:Users:&lt;user&gt;
<li>Startup Volume:Documents
</ol></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top">Macintosh OS 9.x<br>(multi-user)</td><td><ol>
<li>Startup Volume:Users:&lt;user&gt;:Preferences
<li>Startup Volume:Documents
</ol></td></tr>
</table>

<li>The Adobe SVG Viewer now has its own color management support built in.
This support will attempt to locate a suitable device profile for your
display. If your computer has color management software installed and a
monitor profile has been selected, then this monitor profile will also be used
by the Viewer. If you do not have color management installed, or you have
disabled it, the Viewer will look for an Adobe Monitor Settings profile on
your system.  This profile is created by the Adobe Gamma tool (installed with
other Adobe products), and is usually stored in the same directories as other
color profiles on the host system.  Failing to find any suitable device
profile, the Viewer will fall back on the standard sRGB profile and use that
for all rendering.
<li>The Netscape plug-in now supports DOM access from Java clients.
<li>The ActiveX control now supports non-JavaScript (e.g. Visual Basic) event
handlers.
<li>Modifications for Windows 2000 compatibility.
<li>Added an alternate way to pan SVG graphics with the keyboard for
accessibility.  If the scroll-lock is on, the arrow keys will pan the SVG
graphic that has the focus.
<li>Performance enhancements involving multiple simultaneous animations within
the same SVG file. SVG files with small, widely-spaced simultaneous
animations should generally display faster in the current version than in
Version 1.0.
<li>Mac plug-in performance enhancements.
<li>Improved support for vertical text.
<li>Added support for bi-directional text.
<li>General performance optimizations.
<li>Modified <code>feImage</code> to work like the <code>use</code> element.
<li>Updated support for PNG images.
<li>Memory usage optimizations.
<li>Added support for animating paths.
</ul>

</ul>
