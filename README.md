Got my hands on this camera, but couldn't find any drivers for it(official site is down), so I found a full complect with official included driver disc.<br />
Hope it helps some people that still want to use this camera.<br />
This is just a copy of that disc.<br />

# Better download [archive](https://github.com/ypurat56/enigma-1.3-digital-dream-driver/releases/download/1.0.0/Enigma1_3_driver.zip) from release page
github lfs messed up with big files(.cab), so it breaks if u just download from code :/ 
## To use just run `CDSETUP.exe`

### Installer also includes:
- Eyestar Mail
- Ulead Photo Express 4.0 SE
- Instruction Manual

The only way I found for it to work, is by using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with Windows XP.
